# radio

A simple program to play static and utilize a potentiometer to read in the current station to play specific radio sounds based on the current frequency tuned to.  Currently will play static
in the background and will need to mix in a foreground track when the specific frequency, as defined by the yaml file, dictates.  Will need to add in a fade in/ fade out type effect.
